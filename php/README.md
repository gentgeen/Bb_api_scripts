PHP README
====================================

I should add a detailed "what is required" here, but I haven't really
kept track of exactly what is or isn't used.  It is pretty standard for 
me to simply have full PHP installs on my Linux boxes, so I have not 
kept track of what is needed for these particular scripts.

Here is some basic info from my PHP install where I use these scripts,
so I assume this should help :-)
