# Bb_api_scripts

The repo holds all of the various  REST-API scripts I use/have written
as the Blackboard admin.    Most (all?) of these scripts are not for
daily syncing, but for tasks that make my life as an admin easier.

How to get started with Blackboard API:

Requirements:

  - All scripts are writing in bash (Linux command line)
		  Must have `curl` and `jq` installed
  - Put your own credentials and URLs in the Bb_api-creds.example and
      rename to "Bb_api-creds.sh"
